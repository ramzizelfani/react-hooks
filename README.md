# Getting Started with React Hooks

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It was created to discover and play around with different out of the box react hooks introduced by the react core team since React v16.8.0. It covers also how to create some custom hooks and reuse them. This project is based upon an awesome tutorial by [Codevolution](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC3y8-rFHvwisvxhZ135pogtX7_Oe3Q3A)
Hooks covered on this tutorial as as follow:

- useState
- useEffect
- useContext
- useReducer
- useMemo
- useCallback
- useRef
- Some Custom Hooks

You can find each of those hooks code samples in a branch having the same name
